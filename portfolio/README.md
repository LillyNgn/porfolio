HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript web side portfolio created at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth
I enjoyed so much to create a porfolio website. I started my first portfolio from complicated codes with my cousin helps, then I tried to use bootstrap for my second website , but I wanted to code something simple and organized, so I started the new website, where I used HTML, CSS & Javascript for my smooth animation in my website. I learnt a lot about coding during this semester. I tried out Javascriptt, but it is the hardest coding work. I would like to code another websites, where I can play more around and learn more code stuff. I want to improve myself more and more. Coding take a lot of time and researches. I found my favorite youtubers, who explain, teach and do awesome coding jobs. My favorite youtubers are DarkCode ( he does awesome animation elements coding stuff  by using HTML & CSS), Code grid ( he shows how to code an unique website and svg tutorials) and Online Tutorials ( he shows the best tricks, which you can use on your website). 
The coding for one website take a lot of time, but at the end it worth. I want to try out svg and to play more with it for my next work. I had some trouble to push into github, but I have no idea , how I could figure it out and push everything on github.
